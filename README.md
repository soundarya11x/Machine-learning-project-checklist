# Machine-learning-project-checklist
- We are required to deal with so many elements in a project (wrangling, preparation, questions, models, fine-tuning, etc.), itâ€™s easy to lose track of things.
- Checklist guides us to check if every task has been executed successfully or not.

## Steps
### 1. Understanding the problem statement:
     1. Classifying the problem - Supervised (Classification or Regression) / Unsupervised)
     2. Understanding the metadata
     3. Understanding the inherent assumptions of the data
### 2. Data collection
     1.In most cases, this step can be executed before the first step if data is available
